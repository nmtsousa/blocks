# Blocks

In this project you will find the steps taken to develop a blocks puzzle, similar to Tetris. The project is being built in the open and I am documenting the major decisions in articles.

## Current State Of The Project

The project is a Flutter application. To run it:

```bash
flutter test && flutter run
```

It will run all tests and the application in a simulator of your choice.

## All Iterations
